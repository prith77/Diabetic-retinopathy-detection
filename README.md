# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among  diabetic patients. Early detection and precise classification of DR severity levels are crucial for timely  intervention. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based multi-label classification model for automated  DR detection and treatment recommendation.
